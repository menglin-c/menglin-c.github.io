I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I received the B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, the B.Eng. degree from the University of Birmingham, U.K. in 2012, the M.S. degree and Ph.D. degree from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in 2013 and 2018, respectively. I had been an academic visitor in the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary, University of London from May 2017 to October 2017. I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at HKU from 2018 to 2022. 

I received the *URSI Young Scientist Award* in 2024, *PIERS Young Scientist Award* in 2023, *ACES Young Scientist Award* in 2021, and various student paper awards from 2016 to 2018. So far, I have published 22 top-tier journals (12 journals as the first author, 2 journal as the corresponding author) and 3 book chapters. One of my first-author manuscripts published in *Physical Review Letters* was selected as “Editors’ Suggestion” in 2022. One of my first-author manuscripts was listed as “the ESI Highly Cited Paper (top 1%)” in 2019. One of my first-author manuscripts published in *Applied Sciences* was selected as “Featured Papers” in 2018. One of my second-author manuscripts published in *Reviews in Physics* was listed as “the Top Cited Articles for publications since Jan. 2021” in 2023 and 2024. My research interests include (i) Advanced electromagnetics-based interdisciplinary research, including those in metamaterials, metasurfaces, and photonic crystals, (ii) topological electromagnetics and its applications in microwave/millimeter wave engineering, and (iii) novel antenna and metasurface design in IoT-based smart buildings.
