**Dr. CHEN Menglin** is currently a research assistant professor at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. She received the B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, the B.Eng. degree from the University of Birmingham, U.K. in 2012, the M.S. degree and Ph.D. degree from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in 2013 and 2018, respectively. She had been an academic visitor in the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary, University of London from May 2017 to October 2017. She was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at HKU from 2018 to 2022. Dr. CHEN received the *PIERS Young Scientist Award* in 2023, the *ACES Young Scientist Award* in 2021, and various student paper awards. Dr. CHEN has so far published 20 top-tier journals (12 journals as the first author, 1 journal as the corresponding author) and 3 book chapters. One of her first-author manuscripts published in *Physical Review Letters* was selected as **“Editors’ Suggestion”** in 2022. One of her first-author manuscripts was selected as **“the ESI highly-cited paper (top 1%)”** in 2019. One of her first-author manuscripts published in *Applied Sciences* was selected as **“Featured Papers”** in 2018. Her research interests include (i) Advanced electromagnetics-based interdisciplinary research, including those in metamaterials, metasurfaces, and photonic crystals, (ii) topological electromagnetics and its applications in microwave/millimeter wave engineering, and (iii) novel antenna and metasurface design in IoT-based smart buildings.
